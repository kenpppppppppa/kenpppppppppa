Write a program to get integers from the user, and return the largest and smallest integer. Specifically, it first prompts the user to specify how many integers they intend to enter, which is denoted as n. Then, the program collects n integer inputs from the user, identifies the largest and smallest integer among them, and prints out.
面
~ Example
Case1:
How many integers: 4
Enter an integer: 5
Enter an integer: 3
Enter an integer: 2
Enter an integer: 8
The largest number is: 8
The smallest number is: 2
Case2:
How many integers: 5
Enter an integer: 9
Enter an integer: 3
Enter an integer: -1
Enter an integer: 8
Enter an integer: 9
The largest number is: 9
The smallest number is: -1
Tips
1. The number of input integers is not smaller than 3.
2. The input integers range from -100 to 100.
3. All the inputs from the user can be converted as integers. In other words, the user will not input strings like '1.5', 'apple', or 'Ox1'.
~ Requirements
1. The functionality of the program and function should be correct.
2. You should use for-loop or while-loop to answer this question.
